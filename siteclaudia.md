## Repeat to improve
What makes a design proces fundamentally different from a production process, is that repetition improves the result. Starting with quick sketches, ignoring most details, next steps take more time. It’s not a lineair process, it’s a iterative process, which means repeating the previous step in more detail.

## *Design Design Space*: what is it?
*Design Design Space* is an online coaching environment to develop your design skills. Query your questions and improve your sketching. Acquire new techniques and research your presentations. In short, a space where you can design your design process.[['What kind of problems and challenges do you experience in your daily work as a designer']]
 
Working closely together online with experienced designers and a group of collegue students, there is space to define your own study topics and challenges. In fact, such a selection and planning process is an integral part of the study itself. You tell us what you want, and together we’ll find a way to get there.

Study path lengths vary from 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, [[1 season and maybe]] 1 year, whatever fits best to your plans, your practical possibilities and your financial situation.
 
## 1 day • 1 week • 1 month • 1 year
The core idea behind designing the design process, is that it doesn’t make a difference for how long you practice it. A project of 1 hour, basically goes through the same stages (research – design – presentation) as a project of 1 year. Where in practice 80% of the work is done in the last 20% (or less) of the available time.[[ well is matters how long you study. the stadia in the design process are fundamentally the same. Depending on the lenght of time, their will be more details to focus and to work on]]

That mismatch is fundamental to design. Too optimistic in the beginning – the next one always will be better – a design is never finished. But in the mean time, the fact that most designs are supposed to meet external requirements, the final deadline defines the quality of the result, not the opinion of the designer.[[herschrijven denk ik; hier staan 'doorgaanse werkelijkheid en gewenste situatie door elkaar. Van belang in welk perspectief we dit schrijven]]

### Design methods
Over the years a magnitude of design methods have been developed, unformtunately they all share the common goal to meet the deadline with an optimum of available functions.[[give some examples]]
You may recognize that in your current design practice.

What most design methods don’t do is create space for designers to develop themselves: To allow intended mistakes, leading to new directions. Cuddle solutions that don’t seem to be profitable right away. To spend time on acquiring skills without predefined purpose.

For the development of skills, such an approach is essential. 

*Design Design Space* offers that environment. To study a specific topic for a defined period of time. Offering challenges, feedback, techniques and design methods that are customized to your development.

### Experience
*Design Design Space* taps into 35 years of studio projects and over 50 years of combined experience of/in design education. Projects ranging from corporate identities, type design, typographic software, interiors, environmental design and running design studios and design games.

### Flow control
Staging a project into small chunks gives better control on every aspect. Popular scrum techniques are a good example of that technique. Yet, they are mostly oriented towards time management, function implementation and linear development.

[[In a ideal situation]] If the design process is implemented as a sequence of repetitions, with increasing length and levels of detail, there is more space for improvement, if requirements are new and untested. 

'If a project will last for 3 or 6 months, what is it that you are really busy with tomorrow?'

### Detail management
Sketching is the process of eliminating of unwanted options of all possibilities, without visualizing every single aspect. 

Sketching is the process of managing the level of details, throughout the process. One method is reduce the scale of drawings, as the resolution of tools (pencil or screen) automatically will hide irrelevant details.

### How does Design relate to Art?
Design can be seen as position between Art (0% defined) and Production (100% defined). But what that percentage is – and if this is a relevant model at all – needs to be defined for every project. How would you do that? How would you balance between being a creative artist and making sure that the design is finished in time, to full user satisfaction? What would your process be for such a task?

~~~

### What is the time frame?
There are several options, ranging from 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 1 year, all offering the same process. The difference is the level of details, development of skill and amount of specialization in specific topcis.

### What does it cost?

There are 4 possible training levels.

~~~Python
"""
* 1 day $150
* 1 week $800 (7 days)
* 1 month $2000 (calendar month)
* 1 year $6000

For students who whish to extend one time frame into another, the payed amount will be deducted by 50%.

* 1 day extending into 1 week: 1/2 $150 + $800 = $875
* 1 week extending into 1 month: 1/2 $800 + $2000 = $2400
* 1 day extending into 1 week extending into 1 month: 1/2 $800 + $2000 = $2400
* 1 month extending into one year: 1/2 $2000 + $6000 = $7000
* 1 week extending into 1 month extending into 1 year: 1/2 $2400 + $6000 = $7200

"""
~~~

Tuition needs to be payed before the training starts. 
No refunding is possible, but students have the right to build in breaks for some period of time, if that is discussed before hand. 
In exceptional situations payment in portions can be discussed.

### What is the schedule & how to submit?

Every 3 months a new day-week-month-year sequence starts, under the condition that there are at least 3 students. 

The coaches have the right to decide postponing the start of a new sequence, if not enough students submitted and group them together.

Since working as a team of students a minimum amount is required, and also a mininum level of quality, motivation, dedication and experience. 

Students are submitted after showing their portfolios and the result of a given assignment. They have to write a motivation and development plan, which will be presented in a Google Hangout.
If there is enough time between submission and the start of a new sequence, students can get some initial assignment to work on without coaching. 
The volume this depends on the length of the of the training that students apply for.

Students finishing one training level adequately, automatically get admitions for a next level.

### How does it work?

* Design students meet online with each other and the coaches in regular intervals.
* Students get assignments for design projects with time frames ranging from several hours to several months. The assignments are challenges, for which specific topics can be filled by the individual students.
* Questions how to approach these challenges, research on what skills need to be developed, what knowledge needs to be acquired and what techniques/materials need to be developed and how to design the planning for the project, are all part of the assignment. 
* With regular intervals (ranging from hours to days to once per week) the various levels of intermediate results are presented to the group of students and coaches. It is the aim of the coaches to create a safe environment in which anything can be said about any aspect of the work and the process.
* The process of creating such a safe environment and the methods for feed-back themselves are part of the assignments, and therefor subject to sketching and modification too.
* In the presentations feed-back is given on the presented work, but also on the presentation itself and on the process and proceedings between presentations. 

~~~Python
"""
### Biggest advantage of this activity for us

* Not bound to any accreditation or institution
* No startup cost
* Highly scalable in volume of students
* Highly scalable in contributing teachers
* Very flexible in focus, content and directions
* Works anywhere, anytime, any language, country and culture, as long as people get online.
* Large “touch base” of students who already have similar experience in our regular lessons
* A lot of this we already have available as assignments, examples, etc.
* Flexible in pricing for special cases.
* Focus is on design students, not on buildings, organizations and degrees.
"""

### The design process

The idea behind every *Design Design Space* training is that every design process can be divided into three phases: research, design and presentation.
As e.g. the research phase by definition has design and presentation aspects (answering questions such as “How am I going to do the research” and “How am I going to present the research results?”), every phase has this division in three, making a recursive structure.
Of course the required time and level of details are subject of choice, but that itself is a design question to be answered.

### Personal design space

An important aspect of every design project is that it is a journey, a travel, with some definition of starting point, some definition of the target, but – by definition – an undefined path from one to the other. Otherwise that path would have been called a production process.

From the personal experience for the designer, such a journey has always had conditions that must be filled for success.

### What will you design 10 years from now?
With increasing speed, values and skills of 10 years ago have become obsolete. What do you need to do, to be a professional designer 10 years from now? Or 20? Or 30? 

How do you prepare for a future where basic skills are taken over by AI. How can your train yourself to learn to adapt. 

Instead of following the future developments, how can you participate in defining and designing them?

### Design is a cycle
If design is a cycle, then where does it end? When that is up to the designer to decide – until it’s good enough – that will never happen (right). 
Reality is that the design process ends if all time is used. BUt how to make sure that the design is complete, with enough details to be appreciated by a user?

### Specialization topics

In all of the four time frames (1 day, 1 week, 1 month or 1 year) students can select a combination of specializations (where this selection process itself also is part of the design skills to be developed).
The difference between the time frames is the level of details and the amount of skill training. For the rest each phase in the process is a recursive copy of one of the others.

The combination of any 2 or 3 topics from the list below gives each students a unique personal research environment to develop.

#### Topics

* Typography
* Type design
* Design for fashion
* Design of information visualization
* Interior and exhibition design
* Design for multiple media from single source
* Parametric design, programming and coding
* Corporate identity design

#### Process

* Design of research methods
* Sketching techniques
* Design the design process
* Presentation techniques
* Design of feedback and evaluation techniques
* Design of testing methods

#### Contexts

* Design education
* Working in teams, running a studio
* Dealing with customers
* Design for users

Each of these items contains a world of detailed knowledge and design parameters that can be developed with other students who select such a topic. As example, for typography (and with reference to adjacent topics) this next level could contain a selection of:

* **Typographic parameters** Categories, bandwidth of possible values, presentation examples, …
* **Typographic layout** Principles, transformation of historic examples, whitespace, aesthetics, …
* **Typographic tools** Grid, type, size, leading, spacing, kerning, width, hyphenation, orientation, contrast, color, pattern, proportion, ratio, interaction, position, meaning, language, any combination and addition to the parameters of Bertin, …
* **Design the process** Base requirements, testing, planning, cooperation with other disciplines, research, marketing, promotion, difference between single solution and generative rules, selection and design of research methods, …
* **Mathematics for designers** Sin/cos/tan/atan, position, rotation, transformation matrices, column calculation, statistics, logarithmic, ranges, light game theory, principles of AI, neural networks and machine learning, …
* **Type design** Variation axes, design of parameters, design of selection criteria, design of the process, …
* **Images as typographic elements** Illustration, photography, info-graphics, ...
* **Target areas** Culture, fashion, politics, international relation, trade, education, …
* **Educating typography** Educating bachelor students, customers, users, yourself inside design cycles, presenting, writing about…
* **Programming** Structure, hierarchy, design of algorithms, …
* **Coding** All relevant languages related to typography: deepest relevant of Processing, Python, JS, PHP, CSS, HTML, XML, Objective-C, …
* **Tools** Deepest of Adobe applications, scripting, OSX-terminal tools, design of information conversion flows, research on raw data, …
* **Device Measurements** resolution, distortion, proportion, memory usage, …
* **Storage techniques** File, database, formats, git, JSON, plist, XML, UFO, …


## Cases
What we plan to do can best be describe in some cases.

### Case 1 Design of selection and feedback
3 posters, similar and different in one series, for a topic of your choice. Assignemnt is how to judge the result and how to select from various judging methods.
*How to develop criteria 

### Case 2 Basic skills
Painting of color/gray ranges. Sketching with materials, proportions, ratio and contrast.

Although much of your work may have digital outcome, actually making stuff opens up new directions, other points of view.

### Case 3 Sketching methods
One week to fill a 100 page Moleskine sketchbook, design for a specific subject, context or design challenge.
The presentation is showing 5 best pages in combination with validation criteria used.

### Case 4 Design research methods inside the design process
This is the integral assignment for TypeMedia 2017 students at the end of their Master year. They have limited time of 2 weeks to write and design 3 mini-thesis document of one page each. Illustrated and documented.

### Case 5 Design interactive poster
What is a relevant set of parameters for a poster? And how does interaction play a role in that? What is the design process? How do you test the intermediate result? What needs to happen to guearantee success?

### Case 6 Design of corporate identity models
Research models where applications can have different usage, technique and message, and still belong to the same brand? What are parameters and what freedom do designers later in the process have?
Which of these parameters need to be documented? And which can be automated?

### Petr van Blokland

Petr van Blokland (1956, Netherlands) graduated cum laude from the graphic arts program at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KABK) in The Hague in 1980.

With his partner Claudia Mens, Van Blokland worked for over thirty-five years as a designer in the studio they cofounded. His output ranged from sketching and model-making to programming in various languages. He specialized in systematic design: corporate identities, form systems, online publications, and tools for type design.

Van Blokland has taught graphic design, typography, and type design for many years at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KABK) in The Hague and at the Academy of Fine Arts, Arnhem. His first typeface was Proforma, a large series commissioned by Purup, a Danish manufacturer of form-preparation systems. Proforma has now been released for general use through Type Network. In 1988, Van Blokland’s work brought him ATypI’s coveted Charles Peignot Prize.

As cofounder and partner of Type Network, Van Blokland is a dedicated contributor and developer of new type and tools for type design. He currently teaches in the Master’s program in Graphic Design at AKV|St.Joost in Breda and at Type and Media, the postgraduate type design program at KABK in The Hague. Read more about his thoughts on design and education in this interview and in his Lubalin lecture, <a href="https://vimeo.com/133052206" target="External">Words</a> delivered at Cooper Union in 2015.
