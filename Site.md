## Repeat to improve
What makes a design proces fundamentally different from a production process, is that repetition improves the result. Starting with quick sketches, ignoring most details, next steps take more time.

## *Design Design Space*: what is it?
*Design Design Space* is an online coaching environment to develop your design skills. Query your questions and improve your sketching. Acquire new techniques and research your presentations. In short, a space where you can design your design process. 

Working closely together online with experienced designers and a group of collegue students, there is space to define your own study topics and challenges. In fact, such a selection and planning process is an integral part of the study itself. You tell us what you want, and together we’ll find a way to get there.

Study path lengths vary from 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 1 year, whatever fits best to your plans, your practical possibilities and your financial situation.
 
## 1 day • 1 week • 1 month • 1 year
The core idea behind designing the design process, is that it doesn’t make a difference for how long you do it. A project of 1 hour, basically goes through the same stages (resarch – design – presentation) as a project of 1 year. Where in practice 80% of the work is done in the last 20% (or less) of the available time.

That mismatch is fundamental to design. Too optimistic in the beginning – the next one always will be better – a design is never finished. But in the mean time, the fact that most designs are supposed to meet external requirements, the final deadline defines the quality of the result, not the opinion of the designer.

### Design methods
Over the years a magnitude of design methods have been developed, but unformtunately they all share the common goal to meet the deadline with an optimum of available functions.
You may recognize that in your current design practice.

What most design methods don’t do is create space for designers to develop themselves. To allow unintended mistakes. Cuddle solutions that don’t seem to be porfitable right away. To spend time on acquiring skills without predefined purpose.

Yet, for the development of skill, such an approach is essential. 

*Design Design Space* offers that environment. To study a specific topic for a defined period of time. Offering challenges, feed back, techniques and design methods that are customized to your development.

### Experience
*Design Design Space* taps into 35 of studio projects and over 50 years of combined experience of design education. Projects ranging from corporate identities, type design, typographic software, interiors, environmental design and running design games.

### Flow control
Staging a project into small chunks gives better control on every aspect. Popular scrum techniques are a good example of that technique. Yet, they are mostyl oriented towards time management, function implementation and linear development.

If the design process is more implemented as a sequence of repetitions, with increasing length and detail level, there is more space for improvement, if requirements are new and untested. 

If a project will last for 6 months, what is it that you are really busy with tomorrow?

### Detail managment
Sketching is the process of eliminating unwanted options from the tree of all possibilities, without visualizing every single one of them. 

Sketching is the process of managing the level of details, throughout the process. One method is reduce the scale of drawings, as the resolution of tools (pencil or screen) automatically will hide irrelevant details.

### How does Design relate to Art?
Design can be seen as position between Art (0% defined) and Production (100% defined). But what that percentage is – and if this is a relevant model at all – needs to be defined for every project. How would you do that? How would you balance between being a creative artist and making sure that the design is finished in time, to full user satisfaction? What would your process be for such a task?

~~~

### What is the time frame?
There are several options, ranging from 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 1 year, all offering the same process. The difference is the level of details, development of skill and amount of specialization in specific topcis.

### What does it cost?

There are 4 possible training levels.

~~~Python
"""
* 1 day $150
* 1 week $800 (7 days)
* 1 month $2000 (calendar month)
* 1 year $6000

For students who whish to extend one time frame into another, the payed amount will be deducted by 50%.

* 1 day extending into 1 week: 1/2 $150 + $800 = $875
* 1 week extending into 1 month: 1/2 $800 + $2000 = $2400
* 1 day extending into 1 week extending into 1 month: 1/2 $800 + $2000 = $2400
* 1 month extending into one year: 1/2 $2000 + $6000 = $7000
* 1 week extending into 1 month extending into 1 year: 1/2 $2400 + $6000 = $7200

"""
~~~

Tuition needs to be payed before the training starts. 
No refunding is possible, but students have the right to build in breaks for some period of time, if that is discussed before hand. 
In exceptional situations payment in portions can be discussed.

### What is the schedule & how to submit?

Every 3 months a new day-week-month-year sequence starts, under the condition that there are at least 3 students. 

The coaches have the right to decide postponing the start of a new sequence, if not enough students submitted and group them together.

Since working as a team of students a minimum amount is required, and also a mininum level of quality, motivation, dedication and experience. 

Students are submitted after showing their portfolios and the result of a given assignment. They have to write a motivation and development plan, which will be presented in a Google Hangout.
If there is enough time between submission and the start of a new sequence, students can get some initial assignment to work on without coaching. 
The volume this depends on the length of the of the training that students apply for.

Students finishing one training level adequately, automatically get admitions for a next level.

### How does it work?

* Design students meet online with each other and the coaches in regular intervals.
* Students get assignments for design projects with time frames ranging from several hours to several months. The assignments are challenges, for which specific topics can be filled by the individual students.
* Questions how to approach these challenges, research on what skills need to be developed, what knowledge needs to be acquired and what techniques/materials need to be developed and how to design the planning for the project, are all part of the assignment. 
* With regular intervals (ranging from hours to days to once per week) the various levels of intermediate results are presented to the group of students and coaches. It is the aim of the coaches to create a safe environment in which anything can be said about any aspect of the work and the process.
* The process of creating such a safe environment and the methods for feed-back themselves are part of the assignments, and therefor subject to sketching and modification too.
* In the presentations feed-back is given on the presented work, but also on the presentation itself and on the process and proceedings between presentations. 

~~~Python
"""
### Biggest advantage of this activity for us

* Not bound to any accreditation or institution
* No startup cost
* Highly scalable in volume of students
* Highly scalable in contributing teachers
* Very flexible in focus, content and directions
* Works anywhere, anytime, any language, country and culture, as long as people get online.
* Large “touch base” of students who already have similar experience in our regular lessons
* A lot of this we already have available as assignments, examples, etc.
* Flexible in pricing for special cases.
* Focus is on design students, not on buildings, organizations and degrees.
"""
~~~

### The design process

The idea behind every *Design Design Space* training is that every design process can be divided into three phases: research, design and presentation.
As e.g. the research phase by definition has design and presentation aspects (answering questions such as “How am I going to do the research” and “How am I going to present the research results?”), every phase has this division in three, making a recursive structure.
Of course the required time and level of details are subject of choice, but that itself is a design question to be answered.

### Personal design space

An important aspect of every design project is that it is a journey, a travel, with some definition of starting point, some definition of the target, but – by definition – an undefined path from one to the other. Otherwise that path would have been called a production process.

From the personal experience for the designer, such a journey has always had conditions that must be filled for success.

* Calling; dreams, plans, goals and knowing yourself* Fellowship; the social fabric, the environment of the designer* Dragon; where you stumble, the treasure lies* Performance; stepping into the middle of the moment

### What will you design 10 years from now?
With increasing speed, values and skills of 10 years ago have become obsolete. What do you need to do, to be a professional designer 10 years from now? Or 20? Or 30? 

How do you prepare for a future where basic skills are taken over by AI. How can your train yourself to learn to adapt. 

Instead of following the future developments, how can you participate in defining and designing them?

### Design is a cycle
If design is a cycle, then where does it end? When that is up to the designer to decide – until it’s good enough – that will never happen (right). 
Reality is that the design process ends if all time is used. BUt how to make sure that the design is complete, with enough details to be appreciated by a user?

### Specialization topics

In all of the four time frames (1 day, 1 week, 1 month or 1 year) students can select a combination of specializations (where this selection process itself also is part of the design skills to be developed).
The difference between the time frames is the level of details and the amount of skill training. For the rest each phase in the process is a recursive copy of one of the others.

The combination of any 2 or 3 topics from the list below gives each students a unique personal research environment to develop.

#### Topics

* Typography
* Type design
* Design for fashion
* Design of information visualization
* Interior and exhibition design
* Design for multiple media from single source
* Parametric design, programming and coding
* Corporate identity design

#### Process

* Design of research methods
* Sketching techniques
* Design the design process
* Presentation techniques
* Design of feedback and evaluation techniques
* Design of testing methods

#### Contexts

* Design education
* Working in teams, running a studio
* Dealing with customers
* Design for users

Each of these items contains a world of detailed knowledge and design parameters that can be developed with other students who select such a topic. As example, for typography (and with reference to adjacent topics) this next level could contain a selection of:

* **Typographic parameters** Categories, bandwidth of possible values, presentation examples, …
* **Typographic layout** Principles, transformation of historic examples, whitespace, aesthetics, …
* **Typographic tools** Grid, type, size, leading, spacing, kerning, width, hyphenation, orientation, contrast, color, pattern, proportion, ratio, interaction, position, meaning, language, any combination and addition to the parameters of Bertin, …
* **Design the process** Base requirements, testing, planning, cooperation with other disciplines, research, marketing, promotion, difference between single solution and generative rules, selection and design of research methods, …
* **Mathematics for designers** Sin/cos/tan/atan, position, rotation, transformation matrices, column calculation, statistics, logarithmic, ranges, light game theory, principles of AI, neural networks and machine learning, …
* **Type design** Variation axes, design of parameters, design of selection criteria, design of the process, …
* **Images as typographic elements** Illustration, photography, info-graphics, ...
* **Target areas** Culture, fashion, politics, international relation, trade, education, …
* **Educating typography** Educating bachelor students, customers, users, yourself inside design cycles, presenting, writing about…
* **Programming** Structure, hierarchy, design of algorithms, …
* **Coding** All relevant languages related to typography: deepest relevant of Processing, Python, JS, PHP, CSS, HTML, XML, Objective-C, …
* **Tools** Deepest of Adobe applications, scripting, OSX-terminal tools, design of information conversion flows, research on raw data, …
* **Device Measurements** resolution, distortion, proportion, memory usage, …
* **Storage techniques** File, database, formats, git, JSON, plist, XML, UFO, …


## Cases
What we plan to do can best be describe in some cases.

### Case 1 Design of selection and feedback
3 posters, similar and different in one series, for a topic of your choice. Assignemnt is how to judge the result and how to select from various judging methods.
*How to develop criteria 

### Case 2 Basic skills
Painting of color/gray ranges. Sketching with materials, proportions, ratio and contrast.

Although much of your work may have digital outcome, actually making stuff opens up new directions, other points of view.

### Case 3 Sketching methods
One week to fill a 100 page Moleskine sketchbook, design for a specific subject, context or design challenge.
The presentation is showing 5 best pages in combination with validation criteria used.

### Case 4 Design research methods inside the design process
This is the integral assignment for TypeMedia 2017 students at the end of their Master year. They have limited time of 2 weeks to write and design 3 mini-thesis document of one page each. Illustrated and documented.

### Case 5 Design interactive poster
What is a relevant set of parameters for a poster? And how does interaction play a role in that? What is the design process? How do you test the intermediate result? What needs to happen to guearantee success?

### Case 6 Design of corporate identity models
Research models where applications can have different usage, technique and message, and still belong to the same brand? What are parameters and what freedom do designers later in the process have?
Which of these parameters need to be documented? And which can be automated?

### Petr van Blokland

Petr van Blokland (1956, Netherlands) graduated cum laude from the graphic arts program at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KABK) in The Hague in 1980.

With his partner Claudia Mens, Van Blokland worked for over thirty-five years as a designer in the studio they cofounded. His output ranged from sketching and model-making to programming in various languages. He specialized in systematic design: corporate identities, form systems, online publications, and tools for type design.

Van Blokland has taught graphic design, typography, and type design for many years at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KABK) in The Hague and at the Academy of Fine Arts, Arnhem. His first typeface was Proforma, a large series commissioned by Purup, a Danish manufacturer of form-preparation systems. Proforma has now been released for general use through Type Network. In 1988, Van Blokland’s work brought him ATypI’s coveted Charles Peignot Prize.

As cofounder and partner of Type Network, Van Blokland is a dedicated contributor and developer of new type and tools for type design. He currently teaches in the Master’s program in Graphic Design at AKV|St.Joost in Breda and at Type and Media, the postgraduate type design program at KABK in The Hague. Read more about his thoughts on design and education in this interview and in his Lubalin lecture, <a href="https://vimeo.com/133052206" target="External">Words</a> delivered at Cooper Union in 2015.

### Claudia Mens

Claudia Mens (1957, Netherlands) graduated from the graphic arts program at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KABK) in The Hague in 1980.

With her partner Petr van Blokland, Van Blokland worked for over thirty years as a designer in the studio they cofounded. 

~~~Python 
"""
Let me first introduce myself.
I'm Claudia Mens from the Netherlands.
I'm a designer I studied at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague at the Interior Design Depart and after I graduation I studied at the post study Environmental Design for two years.
At that time, I'm speaking of medio 1980, I was the co-founder of the Design Buro
PvB + CM.
Petr and I are partners as well in business as in private. We have our work/studio in our house with three other designers through all the years and we got three sons.
This year we celebrate our 25th year aniversary of the studio.

About my work
First of all, as a designer I'm interested in people and not really in design by itself.
Before I went to the RA of A I was a school and career counselor for a couple of years.
Which is for me quit familiar with my work now; I'm designing a place for some one,
mental or physical.
I prefer my work as a designer, I love drawing, playing with design principles as color, materials, texture, type, images and so on.

In our studio it's important even it's a need to have our own projects without an inital customer.
Studying and working on something we are interested in and which we want to develop to something we don't know in advance.
This lecture is about Generous Gesture, after two years of playing in my atelier in Delft, outside our studio,  the idea of this project became something 'serious'.

Roots
After several journeys in the recent years to South America, Africa and Asia
I became very aware of my roots.
I'm raised in the south of Holland in a very romantic wooden house in a wood.
As a kid I played in our wood and in the fields around our house all day.
I could lay and hide myself under the ferns for days, for me it was a pleasant and comfortable place.

From this my idea for Generous Gesture was born.
In my atelier I made drawings inspired by my journeys. Working on this gave me a lot of joy.
And I thought of finding a way to share my drawing with others. How to make a product for some one else.Since I'm working as a designer I made various of personal gifts for friends and my family. Silk shawls with type and ornaments using in a batik technique.

Because of this experience I was thinking of a fair trade product in a batik technique,
by producing a series of shawls.
But I didn't know where to go.

At this point I have to tell you a little story of my dad;
He worked as an engineer for Philips and he was travelling for his company all over the world. 
In the 1960 he was connected with a Japanese company and he flew up and down
to Japan for ten years. And after that time, doing business with the Japanese for so long, he told us; 'From this moment, maybe a have a little bit of feeling how a Japanese might be thinking.........'
And he learned/did teach us we have to be carefull and respectfull to other cultures. As arrogant Europeans we have to try very hard to be cooperative and be humble!

So with his lesson I noticed I had to find some one who could be helpfull with my project.
as almost every good things in life, by coinsident I found Elizabeth Visser.
She is a Dutch development-aid worker and she lived and worked for years in Bangladesh with the poorest women in the rural areas of Bangladesh.
Nowadays, besides her work as a development-aid consultant she has her own business named Strawberries Fabrics, selling exclusive, traditional fabrics. All hand-made by local crafts people and women groups from different parts of the world. 
We met each other for the first time about two years ago and she was the perfect match as the important link between me and the producers, between two different cultures.
The contact between me and the people in Bangladesh passes off smoothly thanks to Elizabeth Visser.

Work in Process
Via Elizabeth I got connected with the non governemental organization Kumudini Welfare Trust in Dhaka BD. This Bengali fair trade company has an excellent reputation and is a part of the World Fair Trade Forum. The received the Award of Excellence for Handicrafts south Asia from Unesco in 2008.
Besides work, they give thousand and thousand women (25,000) also health care, workshops and they are sending their kids to school. All those women can earn a living.

My first step with this trust was to make samples in a batik technique. I sent them my first idea about a shawl and after a couple of weeks the first samples came to Delft.
They made it as precisely as possible but we saw that it was to difficult for them to draw the latin type in the batik technique. There were a lot of difficulties about the contrast of the letters they have to make. 
After a few talks we realized what their profession really is; they are the best wood carvers in the world and their Nakshi Kantha embroidery technique is appreciated worldwide. And they are very proud of making and showing this.

So after a long year of hard work, sending ideas, samples, advices to each other
whe developed a series of shawls together, which I couldn't have made without them!
The shawls changed from a square batik silk shawl with personal handwriting by the producer, to a long rectangular silk shawl, block printed and embroidered in the Nakshi Kanthi technique. In the block printing we repeated the text four times. The four different orientations make it readable from any direction.

Generous Gesture as a gift.
Every shawl has a text like Wonderful Woman, Lovely Lover, Fabulous Friend, Marvellous Mother and has an ornamentations of fern leaves as a reminiscence to our  distant past as a roof of foliage, which gave us the natural protection whe needed.

The shawl is a special gift. 
The giver shows what he or she feels to the receiver.
And a little booklet is included by the shawl, you can read that many people helped making this special gift. 
Generous Gesture is in every way a people project.
This project is so special because of the generous gestures people make to each other.
Like the craftsmen in BD by making these beautiful shawls for us.
And Kumudini Welfare trust makes the generouse gesture by providing these people work, healtcare and education. 
A Fair trade certificate is also part of the gift.
and every shawl is unique, all handmade and produced in a limited edition.

I'm very happy with the opportunity I got and I took.
Three weeks ago we received the Bronze Prize of self initiated projects in the European Desig award 2010. And of course except us, the involved people in the Netherlands, this prize is a reward for the people in Bangladesh.


The typography on this series of shawls is made by my partner Petr van Blokland.
Productus the name of this font is...... by the Fontbureau in Boston.
And the Fontbureau, by name of David Berlow, is so generous to support this project. 
 
FB asked me for a men scarfs on which we are working at this moment.
This scarf, made by double layed fabrics of silk and cotton, will be embroired.
The design is a combination of latin and bengoli script; Gentle Gent, also in a alliteration like the omen shawls.

Another project for Generous Gesture is in my sketchbook. I'm leaving for my atelier
within a month. 
Since a while I'm working in a nice place on Marha's Vineyard in the US where I am staying a couple of times times a year. Where a live and work as a monk, in a wooden house in a wood with ferns all over the place.
So it feels like being back on my roots.

For me this excercise of Generous Gesture is about
- my personal project
- a project of pleasure
- a project of patient
- a peoples' project
 
I want to finish my talk by wishing you all the best in your own work.
Make your dreams come through, what ever it is.
It's our mission to show ourselfs who we are, than the rest of the world will notice and enjoy it too.
Thank you for your attention.

After three decades, running a studio from 1980 till 2010, it was time for something else. Claudia went looking and longing for the woods of her childhood. She found that feeling back on Martha's Vineyard in the USA, where she began drawing with childlike pleasure and painting.
