## Repeat to improve
What makes a design proces fundamentally different from a production process, is that repetition improves the result. Starting with quick sketches, ignoring most details, next steps take more time. It’s not a lineair process, it’s a iterative process, which means repeating the previous step in more detail.

## *Design Design Space*
### What is it?
*Design Design Space* is an online coaching environment to develop your design skills. Query your questions and improve your sketching. Acquire new techniques and research your presentations. In short, a space where you can design your design process. 

What kind of challenges do you experience in your daily work as a designer?

Working closely together online with experienced designers and a group of collegue students, there is space to define your own study topics and challenges. In fact, such a selection and planning process is an integral part of the study itself. You tell us what you want, and together we’ll find a way to get there.

### How much time do you need?
The core idea behind designing the design process, is that it doesn’t make a difference for how long you do it. A project of 1 hour, basically goes through the same stages (research – design – presentation) as a project of 1 year. Where in practice 80% of the work is done in the last 20% (or less) of the available time.

Of course, it matters how long you study. the stadia in the design process are fundamentally the same. Depending on the lenght of time, their will be more details to focus and to work on.

This mismatch – how time is spent on what – is fundamental to design. Too optimistic in the beginning (“the next one always will be better”), a design is never finished. But in the mean time, the fact that most designs are supposed to meet external requirements, the final deadline defines the quality of the result, not the opinion of the designer.

### 1 day • 1 week • 1 month • 1 season • 1 year

Study path lengths range from 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 season and possibly 1 year, whatever fits best to your plans, your practical possibilities and your financial situation.

### What does it cost?

* 1 day $150
* 1 week $900 (7 days)
* 1 month $1900 (calendar month)
* 1 season $3900 (3 calendar months)
* 1 year $7900

Discount or split payment for the month, season and year training can be discussed, depending on your personal situation.

Students who whish to extend one training level into another, a 50% discount applies to previous payed tuition. E.g 1 day followed by 1 week: 1/2 $150 + $900 = $975. Or 1 week followed by 1 month: 1/2 $900 + $1900 = $2350. Or 1 week followed by 1 season: 1/2 $900 + $3900 = $4350

Pricing is for individual designers. For corporate trainings or groups, please <a href="mailto:buro@petr.com">contact us</a>.

### What is the schedule & how to submit?

Every 6 months, in March and September, a new day-week-month-season-year sequence starts, most likely if there are at least 3 participating students. 

Day-week sequences or single day Design Games can take place on other dates during the year, if the amount of participants makes it possible.

Since working as a team of students a minimum amount of 3 is required, and also a mininum level of quality, motivation, dedication and experience. 

Season and year-students are submitted after showing their portfolios and the result of a given assignment. Also they are asked to write a motivation and development plan.

Students finishing a training adequately, automatically get accepted for a next.

### How does it work?

Design students meet online with each other and the coaches in regular intervals.

For interaction and exchanging documents a range of techniques are available, e.g. Skype, Google Hangout, Google Docs, offline video, Dropbox, Github, FaceTime and Second Life, to name a few. Selection and usage is topic of one of the assignments.

Students get assignments for imaginary design projects, with time frames ranging from several hours to several months. The assignments are challenges, where the specific topics can be filled by the individual students.

Questions how to approach these challenges, research on what skills need to be developed, what knowledge needs to be acquired and what techniques/materials need to be developed and how to design the planning for the project, are all part of assignments. 

With regular intervals (ranging from hours to days to once per week) the various levels of intermediate results are presented to the group of students and coaches. It is the aim of the coaches to create a safe environment in which anything can be said about any aspect of the work and the process.

The process of creating such a safe environment and the methods for feed-back themselves are part of the assignments, and therefor subject to sketching and modification too.

In the presentations feed-back is given on the presented work, but also on the presentation itself and on the process and proceedings between presentations.

![DesignModels2.048.png](docs/images/DesignModels2.048.png)
Students are offered models for what the design process can be. And they are encouraged to created their own, and apply them to their designs.

### Design methods
In the past a magnitude of design methods have been developed, but unformtunately most of them focus on production techniques and deadlines.
You may recognize that in your current design practice.

What most design methods don’t do is create space for designers to develop themselves. To allow unintended mistakes. Cuddle solutions that don’t seem to be profitable right away. To spend time on acquiring skills without predefined purpose.

Yet, for the development of skill, such an approach is essential. 

*Design Design Space* offers that environment. To study a specific topic for a defined period of time. Offering challenges, feed back, techniques and design methods that are customized to your development.

### Experience
*Design Design Space* taps into 35 of studio projects and over 50 years of combined experience of design education. Projects ranging from corporate identities, type design, typographic software, interiors, environmental design and running Design Games.

Tuition needs to be payed before the training starts. 
No refunding is possible, but participants have the right to build in breaks for some period of time, if that is discussed before hand. 

### What *Design Design Space* can be

* A personal environment to develop design skills, by accepting design challenges, meeting with coaches and colleage students in online feed-back sessions and presentations.
* The design of personal space (time, topic and skills) profession preparation for the rest of your life.
* a part-time sabbatical or a virtual internship
* a place to train design skills and tools.

### What *Design Design Space* is not

* It is not an (online) course
* It is not an (academic) education, leading to Master or PhD
* It is not a school
* It is not a how to InDesign/HTML/CSS/JS/otherDesignTool training
* It is not a series of slides, presentations or a stack of books (although these can be part of it).

### For whom is it intended?

* Graduated design students
* Designers with experience, working in practice
* Designers interested in improving their process
* Designers interested in specializing a specific topic
* Designers interested to develop skill that make them independent from future developments.
* Designers who would like to do a follow-up refresh study, but are lacking time, finance or geographic location to make that work.

In general the aim is to get graduated students as well as experienced designers back to a space of “WOW!”.

Focus is on design students and their individual goals. Not on predefined course content.

### For which designers does *Design Design Space* works best?

* Open minded and willing to get valuable feed-back on their work
* Interested to improve and change
* Interested to participate in the work of colleague students
* Disciplined to work hard between online sessions
* More interested in the development of skills and challenging assignments than assessed diploma’s.

### What *Design Design Space* offers

* Learning how to create an environment and context to design and develop.
* Developing the skill to design the design process.
* Scalable traject: 1 day, 1 week, 1 month or 1 year.
* Online (shared documents, video, hangouts).
* Environment with experienced designer coaches and colleage students. Contact ranging from daily to weekly.
* Each design student defines length, speed of study and select specialization topics.
* The study finishes with a valued certificate on “graduation”, signed by external designers of statue. 
* Short term visible value for students, even with the longer time frames.

## Online Design Game
### Duration 8 hours

For those who ever did a Design Game on location, you’ll recognize the idea behind it. Doing one online, however, will be a new experience.

For those who never did a Design Game, this is a good way to start thinking about your design profession in a totally different way. 

### Preparation
The time frame of an online Design Game, depends on the time zones of the participants. We’ll try to make it as convenient as possible, yet it could be that yours starts at early dawn or late evening. Isn’t that just like working for international customers, expecting you to work on flexible parts of the day?

Virtual studios are formed from 3 or more designers. Since you are likely not in the same physical place or time zone, it is part of the game to find a way of working together. Improvisation is a form of design.
As studio you may want to consider dividing tasks depending on experience and interests.

Design Design Space is a transparant learning environment, where the online Design Game is the most condensed example.

There will be several studios working in a pitch for the same assignment for the same customer. At the end of each round the design get approval points.

The aim is that the best performing studio after 4 rounds wins the game.

In each round a new assignment is given, where the formation of the studios stays the same. This way experience on what went right or wrong in the previous rounds can be used to improve the next result.

### Round 1: Corporate Identity
The first round takes 2 hours to design and present a corporate identity. Details and requirements are given at the start of each round. 

Studios have the possibility to present to their customer through digital media, e.g. by e-mail and hangout, asking questions, showing intermediate sketches.

At the end of each round, the final design of every studio is presented to their customers and the other studios. The customers will judge the process and the result and give feedback.

Scores of each round are visible to the group in an online document.

### Round 2: Another corporate Identity
The second round is similar to the first round – a new corporate identity, different requirements for another customer – but in shorter time.

### Round 3: Magazine
Design and present different types of pages of a magazine. The challenge with working in an virtual environment, is to divide the work between the designers of the studio. What visual parameters define the difference between the types of pages and which parameters make the visual coherence?

### Round 4: Exhibition
Design and present an exhibition space, that fits the given requirements. With photos and video a physical scale model is presented to the customer and the other studios.

In this round all studios will judge and comment the result of all other studios. That feedback is used as part of the final score.
 
### Presentations and feedback
In a presentation where are designs can be compared, a winner is selected. 

### Conclusions
Concluding the 1 day of Design Design Space, feedback is given to the studios and individual designers. What went well? What were challenges? 

#### Trained skills
During the Design Game, several design skills are addressed. 

* Organizing, time management, asking interventions
* Management of detail levels
* Development of sketching techniques
* Communication between designers in a virtual studio
* Asking the right questions to the customer
* Selection of presentation media
* Judging and formulating feedback to other studios

Particpating in the Design Game is required for the extending studies at Design Design Space. From here students can choose to apply for one of the 1 week, 1 month, 1 season or 1 year extended programs.

### Specialization topics

In all of the five time frames (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 season or 1 year) students can select a combination of specializations (where this selection process itself also is part of the design skills to be developed).
Essentially each time frame is a recursive copy of one of the others.
The difference between is the number of topics that can be addressed and the level of details possible.

### Applying topics, process and context
A combination of two or more topics from the list below, in combination with process and context selection, gives students a unique personal research environment for development.

#### Topics

* Typography
* Type design
* Design for fashion
* Design of information visualization
* Interior and exhibition design
* Design for multiple media from single source
* Parametric design, programming and coding
* Corporate identity design

#### Process

* Design of research methods
* Sketching techniques
* Design the design process
* Presentation techniques
* Design of feedback and evaluation techniques
* Design of testing methods

#### Contexts

* Design education
* Working in teams, running a studio
* Dealing with customers
* Design for users

Each of these items contains a world of detailed knowledge and design parameters that can be developed with other students who select such a topic. As example, for typography (and with reference to adjacent topics) this next level could contain a selection of:

* **Typographic parameters** Categories, bandwidth of possible values, presentation examples, …
* **Typographic layout** Principles, transformation of historic examples, whitespace, aesthetics, …
* **Typographic tools** Grid, type, size, leading, spacing, kerning, width, hyphenation, orientation, contrast, color, pattern, proportion, ratio, interaction, position, meaning, language, any combination and addition to the parameters of Bertin, …

## Assignments
Below some example assignments.

### Design of methods for selection and feedback 
3 posters, similar and different in one series, for a topic of your choice. Assignemnt is how to judge the result and how to select from various judging methods.
*How to develop criteria 

### Basic skills
Painting of color/gray ranges. Sketching with materials, proportions, ratio and contrast.

Although much of your work may have digital outcome, actually making stuff with real materials opens up new directions, other points of view.

### Sketching techniques
One week to fill a 100 page Moleskine sketchbook, design for a specific subject, context or design challenge.
The presentation is showing 5 best pages in combination with validation criteria used.

### Design of research methods inside the design process
This is the integral assignment for TypeMedia 2017 students at the end of their Master year. They have limited time of 2 weeks to write and design 3 mini-thesis document of one page each. Illustrated and documented.

### Design of an interactive poster
What is a relevant set of parameters for a poster? And how does interaction play a role in that? What is the design process? How do you test the intermediate result? What needs to happen to guearantee success?

### Design of models for corporate identities
Research models where publications within a corporate identity can have different usage, technique and message, and still visually belong to the same brand. What are parameters and what freedom do designers have later in the process?
Which of these parameters need to be documented? And which can be automated?

### Petr van Blokland

Petr van Blokland (1956, Netherlands) graduated cum laude from the graphic arts program at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KABK) in The Hague in 1980.

With his partner Claudia Mens, Van Blokland worked for over thirty-five years as a designer in the studio they cofounded. His output ranged from sketching and model-making to programming in various languages. He specialized in systematic design: corporate identities, form systems, online publications, and tools for type design.

Van Blokland has taught graphic design, typography, and type design for many years at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KABK) in The Hague and at the Academy of Fine Arts, Arnhem. His first typeface was Proforma, a large series commissioned by Purup, a Danish manufacturer of form-preparation systems. Proforma has now been released for general use through Type Network. In 1988, Van Blokland’s work brought him ATypI’s coveted Charles Peignot Prize.

As cofounder and partner of Type Network, Van Blokland is a dedicated contributor and developer of new type and tools for type design. He currently teaches in the Master’s program in Graphic Design at AKV|St.Joost in Breda and at Type and Media, the postgraduate type design program at KABK in The Hague. Read more about his thoughts on design and education in this interview and in his Lubalin lecture, <a href="https://vimeo.com/133052206" target="External">Words</a> delivered at Cooper Union in 2015.

### Claudia Mens

Claudia Mens (1957, Netherlands) graduated from the Interior Design program at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KABK) in The Hague in 1985. Then she studied at the Master Environmental Design and graduated in 1989 at the KABK as well. 

With her partner Petr van Blokland, she worked and ran the studio van Blokland + Mens for over twenty five years as designer. 

Before she became a designer, she worked as a school and career counselor for a couple of years. In the recent years she has developed as a trainer coach.

Besides her studio work, she has taught at the KABK for over twenty years at the Graphic Design department.

In 2016 she initiated <a href="peppertom.com" target="External">Pepper+Tom</a>, a self initiated project. P+T is “a playing ground” where she presents her series of designed and produced skirts and scarfs. 

Both products are “people’s projects”: working together with a group of professionals under sustainable circumstances, with eco friendly fabrics, under the conditions of “slow fashion”. 

### Crew of others…
Depending on necessary domain knowlegdge, other designers and professionals can be added to the team. Former students, collegue designers, lectureres and relations of the studio are available if that fits the topics at hand.
