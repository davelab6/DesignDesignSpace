<h3>What is the time frame?</h3>
<p>There are several options, ranging from 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 1 year, all offering the same process. The difference is the level of details, development of skill and amount of specialization in specific topcis.</p>
<h3>What does it cost?</h3>
<p>There are 4 possible training levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 day $150</li>
<li>1 week $800 (7 days)</li>
<li>1 month $2000 (calendar month)</li>
<li>1 year $6000</li>
</ul>
<p>For students who whish to extend one time frame into another, the payed amount will be deducted by 50%.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 day extending into 1 week: 1/2 $150 + $800 = $875</li>
<li>1 week extending into 1 month: 1/2 $800 + $2000 = $2400</li>
<li>1 day extending into 1 week extending into 1 month: 1/2 $800 + $2000 = $2400</li>
<li>1 month extending into one year: 1/2 $2000 + $6000 = $7000</li>
<li>1 week extending into 1 month extending into 1 year: 1/2 $2400 + $6000 = $7200</li>
</ul>
<p>Tuition needs to be payed before the training starts. 
No refunding is possible, but students have the right to build in breaks for some period of time, if that is discussed before hand. 
In exceptional situations payment in portions can be discussed.</p>
<h3>What is the schedule & how to submit?</h3>
<p>Every 3 months a new day-week-month-year sequence starts, under the condition that there are at least 3 students. </p>
<p>The coaches have the right to decide postponing the start of a new sequence, if not enough students submitted and group them together.</p>
<p>Since working as a team of students a minimum amount is required, and also a mininum level of quality, motivation, dedication and experience. </p>
<p>Students are submitted after showing their portfolios and the result of a given assignment. They have to write a motivation and development plan, which will be presented in a Google Hangout.
If there is enough time between submission and the start of a new sequence, students can get some initial assignment to work on without coaching. 
The volume this depends on the length of the of the training that students apply for.</p>
<p>Students finishing one training level adequately, automatically get admitions for a next level.</p>
