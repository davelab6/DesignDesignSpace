<h2>Repeat to improve</h2>
<p>What makes a design process fundamentally different from a production process, is that repetition improves the result. Starting with quick sketches, ignoring most details, next steps take more time. It’s not a linear process, it’s an iterative process, which means repeating the previous step in more detail.</p>

<h2>Program 2018</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p><em>Design Design Space</em> is an online coaching environment to develop your design skills. Query your questions and improve your sketching. Acquire new techniques and research your way of presentating. In short, a space where you can design your design process. </p>
<p>What kind of challenges do you experience in your daily work as a designer?</p>
<p>Working closely together online with experienced designers and a group of other students, there is space to define your own study topics and challenges. In fact, such a selection and planning process is an integral part of the study itself. You tell us what you want, and together we’ll find a way to get there.</p>

<h3>Python scripting for typedesigners (4 weeks)</h3>
<h4>February 5 - March 5 (Online, 6 places left) $1.900</h4>
<p>During this 4 week course, typedesigners learn from scratch how to script micro and macro tasks, during their type design process. In a series of short specific assignments, if possible closely related to their daily tasks, the designers learn to recognize design patterns that can be automated, breaking them down into existing functions and ones that need to be developed.</p>
<p>The study will address Python syntax, specifics of scripting for (type)design, planning, testing, basics of UI/UX design, usage of GIT, PageBot and Variable Font proofing scripts and the specifics of output formats such as fontfiles and documents for print and online usage. During the study, students will build their own QA-knowledge base in the form of scripts that test the current status of their designs and font files.  </p>
<p>Special emphasis is on how to design the process to write software for designers. This aspect makes the project of 4 weeks into a real study, different from online courses “Python scripting”. </p>
<p><em>The online workshop builds up from an intensive mixture of personal hangouts, group hangouts, live online presentations by teachers and students, code and document sharing through GitHub and presentations through documents and movies.</em></p>
<p><em>Each study concludes with an online presentation hangout to all participants and guests and results that can be made public will remain visible through the website of the project.</em></p>

<h3>Python scripting for graphic designers</h3>
<h4>February 22 + March 14/15 + March 21/22 (On location Den Bosch NL)</h4>
<p>This is a closed workshop for Master Students Graphic Design St. Joost. Five days of lesson, spread over 4 weeks, will challenge the students to take one or more of their graphic designs and then design the algorithms that either automate production or can be used to generate alternative versions of their original design.
These algorithms will be translated into Python coding, for which a sequence of short exercises to learn systax and code patterns.</p>

<p><a name="robothon-design-design-space-party"></a></p>
<h3>Robothon | Design Design Space Party</h3>
<h4>March 8 (On location, Delft. Free for all Robothon participants)</h4>
<p>Traditional Robothon party in Delft, sponsored by Design Design Space.</p>

<p><a name="scripting-variable-fonts-specimens-for-typedesigners-using-pagebot"></a></p>
<h3>Scripting Variable Fonts specimens for typedesigners using PageBot</h3>
<h4>March 8 or March 9: Lecture during Robothon (KABK, The Hague)</h4>
<p>Petr van Blokland will contribute to Robothon with a demo of open source scripts running in DrawBot/PageBot, generating specimens for Variable Fonts, with layouts and info-graphics that adapt to the types and amount of variable axes and the relations between them.</p>

<p><a name="python-scripting-for-typedesigners-rt"></a></p>
<h3>Python scripting for typedesigners (3 days)</h3>
<h4>March 10-12 (Special Robothon edition, on location in Delft, 12 places left) $450</h4>
<p>As condensed version of the 4-week “scripting for typedesigners” study, these 3 days will address the highlights in order to set typedesigners in the right direction of thinking. The intend is to give designers an overview of their potential toolset and paths how to develop themselves further in their design practice.</p>
<p>Upon request, special emphasis can be put on the development of scripting for Variable Font design and proofing.</p>

<p><a name="scripting-variable-font-specimens-for-typedesigners-using-pagebot"></a></p>
<h3>Scripting Variable Font specimens for typedesigners using PageBot (1 day)</h3>
<h4>April 15 (After Typolabs, on location Berlin, 12 places left) $150</h4>
<p>As condensed version of the 4-week “scripting for typedesigners” study, this single day will address the highlights in order to set typedesigners in the right direction of thinking. The intend is to give designers an overview of their potential toolset and paths how to develop themselves further in their design practice.</p>
<p>Upon request, special emphasis can be put on the development of scripting for Variable Font design and proofing.</p>

<p><a name="design-models"></a></p>
<h3>Design models (1 day)</h3>
<h4>April 24 (Online, 10 places left) $150</h4>
<p>Focus of this one day workshop is on the development and selection of modeling by graphic designers, typographers and type designers. Any design process can only work by managing the level of details. Sketching and the making of small scale models is such a technique, where the design can get an impression about design choices in early stages of the process, without actually making the “real thing”. </p>
<p>Similar techniques apply to the development of parameters and writing code. The workshop does put special emphasis on the integration of all these techniques into one extended toolset that designers can select from.</p>
<p><em>The online workshop builds up from an intensive mixture of personal hangouts, group hangouts, code and document sharing through GitHub and live online presentations by teachers and students.</em></p>

<p><a name="how-to-deal-with-customers"></a></p>
<h3>How to deal with customers? (1 day)</h3>
<h4>April 26 (Online, 11 places left) $150</h4>
<p>Use cases, models, simulations, sketching and presentation techniques are the subject of this 1 day workshop how to deal best with customers. Students are offered to thing about planning in relation to what they charge for their design. The workshop does address the difference between cost and investment, leasure and learning, with special attention on the success of failure.</p>

<h3>TypeLab</h3>
<h4>June 14-16 (On location during Typographics New York, 3 days) Free for participants of Typographics</h4>
<p>The TypeLab at Typographics 2018 will host a series of hands-on work­shops, demos, inter­views, and experiments, June 14–16.
Keeping with its alternative roots, the TypeLab is a space for informal events to complement the main schedule of the Typographics conference – like a multi-day typographic hackathon.</p>

<p><a name="design-game-typographics"></a></p>
<h3>Design Game</h3>
<h4>June 17 (On location during Typographics, Cooper Union, New York, 1 day) Participation is free.</h4>
<p>This event is for designers of all experience levels, students, educators and other professionals. It’s an intensive 4+ hour event, come on time and plan to stay. </p>
<p>Did you ever want to know what clients try to talk about? And why designers always run out of time? Why design processes are not linear and thinking always is? And how to do that as a team? Would you know how it is to balance on the wrong foot? Or why you never should participate in pitches? </p>
<p>36 designers, 9 studios, 3 customers, 13 tables, 42 chairs, 26 designs, 4 rounds and your set of physical drawing tools make the simulated design space where you can seek answers to these questions. But even then, the Design Game may not give you any. But for sure, you’ll get a hell of experience, never to forget.</p>

<h3>Programming typography (1 week)</h3>
<h4>October 1-8 (Online, 16 places left) $900</h4>
<p>Take one of your more complex typographic projects, that you previously made manual in InDesign. Then ask yourself how the design and production could have been automated using your own scripts? And how much more alternatives could you have visualized? And how much less boring production it would have cost you. 
This one week workshop shows directions to get algorithms to work, for the parts you shouldn’t want to do as designer. And safe your time for real design work.
Some experience with DrawBot coding is recommended, but not required for the week of study.</p>
<p><em>The online workshop builds up from an intensive mixture of personal hangouts, group hangouts, live online presentations by teachers and students, code and document sharing through GitHub and presentations through documents and movies.</em></p>

<p><a name="rapid-prototyping-for-graphic-designers"></a></p>
<h3>Rapid prototyping for graphic designers (1 week)</h3>
<h4>November 5-12 (Online, 16 places left) $900</h4>
<p>With the definition that design is “management of details”, the design process is essentially controlling the amount of details relevant to a certain stage. In order to get insight on how realistic an idea is (on any level of a project), prototype must be made, as early in the process as possible. This is a very generic characteristic of design. 
This workshop offers an overview and the development of some prototyping techniques for graphic designers, typographers and typdesigners using a mixture of physical sketching, standard digital tools and coding. Focus of the workshop is to give students enough options and directions to develop themselves further.</p>

<h3>Sketching techniques (1 day + 1 week + intermediate support)</h3>
<h4>November 19 and November 26-December 3 (Online, 16 places left) $1.200</h4>
<p>Similar to the “Rapid Prototyping” workshop, this too addresses the management of details. But instead, it is more focussed on developing sketching skills than the making of working prototypes.</p>

<h3>Is it for you?</h3>
<p>By definition designers are bad planners. It seems to be fundamental to design. Too optimistic in the beginning – “There is still plenty of time”, a design is never finished – “The next one will always be better”. Do you recognize?</p>
<p>However, the fact that most designs are supposed to meet external requirements, the final deadline may have a much larger impact on the quality of the result, than the personal opinion of the designer.</p>
<p>How do you make this apparent conflict work to your advantage? Would you benefit from exercises and coaching?</p>
<h3>How much time do you need?</h3>
<p>The core idea behind designing the design process, is that it doesn’t make a difference for how long you do it. A project of 1 hour, basically goes through the same stages (research – design – presentation) as a project of 1 year. </p>
<p>Of course, it does matters how long you study something, for the level of details that can be addressed. But if you only have a day or a week for an assignment, then that is part of the requirements. The result can still be better than anything your customer would have done. </p>
<p>How would you design such a design process better next time?</p>
<pre><code class="Python">"""
### 1 day • 1 week • 1 month • 1 season • 1 year
