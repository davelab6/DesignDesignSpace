<h2>Repeat to improve</h2>
<p>What makes a design proces fundamentally different from a production process, is that repetition improves the result. Starting with quick sketches, ignoring most details, next steps take more time. It’s not a lineair process, it’s a iterative process, which means repeating the previous step in more detail. </p>

<h2><em>Design Design Space</em></h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p><em>Design Design Space</em> is an online coaching environment to develop your design skills. Query your questions and improve your sketching. Acquire new techniques and research your presentations. In short, a space where you can design your design process. </p>
<p>What kind of challenges do you experience in your daily work as a designer?</p>
<p>Working closely together online with experienced designers and a group of collegue students, there is space to define your own study topics and challenges. In fact, such a selection and planning process is an integral part of the study itself. You tell us what you want, and together we’ll find a way to get there.</p>
<h3>How much time do you need?</h3>
<p>The core idea behind designing the design process, is that it doesn’t make a difference for how long you do it. A project of 1 hour, basically goes through the same stages (research – design – presentation) as a project of 1 year. Where in practice 80% of the work is done in the last 20% (or less) of the available time.</p>
<p>Of course, it matters how long you study. the stadia in the design process are fundamentally the same. Depending on the lenght of time, their will be more details to focus and to work on.</p>
<p>This mismatch – how time is spent on what – is fundamental to design. Too optimistic in the beginning (“the next one always will be better”), a design is never finished. But in the mean time, the fact that most designs are supposed to meet external requirements, the final deadline defines the quality of the result, not the opinion of the designer.</p>
<h3>1 day • 1 week • 1 month • 1 season • 1 year</h3>
<p>Study path lengths vary from 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 season and possibly 1 year, whatever fits best to your plans, your practical possibilities and your financial situation.</p>
<h3>What does it cost?</h3>
<p>There are 5 possible training levels.</p>
<pre><code class="Python">"""
* 1 day $150
* 1 week $900 (7 days)
* 1 month $1900 (calendar month)
* 1 season $3900 (3 calendar months)
* 1 year $7900

Discount or split payment for the month, season and year training can be discussed, depending on personal situation.

For designers who whish to extend one training level into another, a 50% discount applies to previous payed tuition.

* 1 day followed by 1 week: 1/2 $150 + $900 = $975
* 1 week followed by 1 month: 1/2 $900 + $1900 = $2350

"""
</code></pre>

<p>Tuition needs to be payed before the training starts. 
No refunding is possible, but participants have the right to build in breaks for some period of time, if that is discussed before hand. </p>
<h3>What is the schedule & how to submit?</h3>
<p>Every 6 months, starting in March and September, a new day-week-month-season-year sequence starts, under the condition that there are at least 3 participants. </p>
<p>Day-week sequences or single day Design Games can take place on other date during the year, if the amount oof participants allows that.</p>
<p>The Design Design Space* organization mayd decide to postpone the start of a new sequence, if not enough students submitted and group them together.</p>
<p>Since working as a team of students a minimum amount of 3 is required, and also a mininum level of quality, motivation, dedication and experience. </p>
<p>Students are submitted after showing their portfolios and the result of a given assignment. They have to write a motivation and development plan, which will be presented in a Google Hangout.
If there is enough time between submission and the start of a new sequence, students can get some initial assignment to work on without coaching. 
The volume this depends on the length of the of the training that students apply for.</p>
<p>Students finishing one training level adequately, automatically get admitions for a next level.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Design students meet online with each other and the coaches in regular intervals. </li>
<li>Students get assignments for design projects with time frames ranging from several hours to several months. The assignments are challenges, for which the  specific topics can be filled by the individual students.</li>
<li>Questions how to approach these challenges, research on what skills need to be developed, what knowledge needs to be acquired and what techniques/materials need to be developed and how to design the planning for the project, are all part of the assignment. </li>
<li>With regular intervals (ranging from hours to days to once per week) the various levels of intermediate results are presented to the group of students and coaches. It is the aim of the coaches to create a safe environment in which anything can be said about any aspect of the work and the process.</li>
<li>The process of creating such a safe environment and the methods for feed-back themselves are part of the assignments, and therefor subject to sketching and modification too.</li>
<li>In the presentations feed-back is given on the presented work, but also on the presentation itself and on the process and proceedings between presentations. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Flow control</h3>
<p>Staging a project into small chunks gives better control on every aspect. Popular scrum techniques are a good example of that technique. Yet, they are mostyl oriented towards time management, function implementation and linear development.</p>
<p>If the design process is more implemented as a sequence of repetitions, with increasing length and detail level, there is more space for improvement, if requirements are new and untested. </p>
<p>If a project will last for 6 months, what is it that you are really busy with tomorrow?</p>

<h3>Detail managment</h3>
<p>Sketching is the process of eliminating unwanted options from the tree of all possibilities, without visualizing every single one of them. </p>
<p>Sketching is the process of managing the level of details, throughout the process. One method is reduce the scale of drawings, as the resolution of tools (pencil or screen) automatically will hide irrelevant details. </p>
