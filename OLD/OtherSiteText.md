### Flow control
Staging a project into small chunks gives better control on every aspect. Popular scrum techniques are a good example of that technique. Yet, they are mostyl oriented towards time management, function implementation and linear development.

If the design process is more implemented as a sequence of repetitions, with increasing length and detail level, there is more space for improvement, if requirements are new and untested. 

If a project will last for 6 months, what is it that you are really busy with tomorrow?

### Detail managment
Sketching is the process of eliminating unwanted options from the tree of all possibilities, without visualizing every single one of them. 

Sketching is the process of managing the level of details, throughout the process. One method is reduce the scale of drawings, as the resolution of tools (pencil or screen) automatically will hide irrelevant details.

### How does Design relate to Art?
Design can be seen as position between Art (0% defined) and Production (100% defined). But what that percentage is – and if this is a relevant model at all – needs to be defined for every project. How would you do that? How would you balance between being a creative artist and making sure that the design is finished in time, to full user satisfaction? What would your process be for such a task?

### Design a food poster.
How would you approach such a project? What is the assignment runs for 2 days? Or 2 weeks? Or 2 months? What would be different in you process? And what is always the same?

### What is the time frame?
There are several options, ranging from 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 1 year, all offering the same process. The difference is the level of details, development of skill and amount of specialization in specific topcis.

### Biggest advantage of this activity for us

* Not bound to any accreditation or institution
* No startup cost
* Highly scalable in volume of students
* Highly scalable in contributing teachers
* Very flexible in focus, content and directions
* Works anywhere, anytime, any language, country and culture, as long as people get online.
* Large “touch base” of students who already have similar experience in our regular lessons
* A lot of this we already have available as assignments, examples, etc.
* Flexible in pricing for special cases.
* Focus is on design students, not on buildings, organizations and degrees.

### The design process

The idea behind every *DesignDesign.Space* training is that every design process can be divided into three phases: research, design and presentation.
And since the “How to do research?” and “How to do the presentation?” don’t have straight standards answers, so they are subject to a design process themselves.

As e.g. the research phase by definition has design and presentation aspects (answering questions such as “What strategy, level of detail and resources word best for research?” and “How am I going to present results of the research?”), every phase has this division in three, making a recursive structure.

Of course the required time and level of details are subject of choice, but that itself is a design question to be answered.

### Personal design space

An important aspect of every design project is that it is a journey, a travel, with some definition of starting point, some definition of the target, but – by definition – an undefined path from one to the other. Otherwise that path would have been called a production process.

From the personal experience for the designer, such a journey has always had conditions that must be filled for success.

* Calling; dreams, plans, goals and knowing yourself
* Fellowship; the social fabric, the environment of the designer
* Dragon; where you stumble, the treasure lies
* Performance; stepping into the middle of the moment 
* Return; bringing home the Holy Grail

### What will you design 10 years from now?
With increasing speed, values and skills of 10 years ago have become obsolete. What do you need to do, to be a professional designer 10 years from now? Or 20? Or 30? 

How do you prepare for a future where basic skills are taken over by AI. How can your train yourself to learn to adapt. 

Instead of following the future developments, how can you participate in defining and designing them?

### Design is a cycle
If design is a cycle, then where does it end? When that is up to the designer to decide – until it’s good enough – that will never happen (right). 
Reality is that the design process ends if all time is used. BUt how to make sure that the design is complete, with enough details to be appreciated by a user?
